__Work In Progress__

America has always had a conflicting place in my mind. How can a country that has so many great things going for it have so many flaws at the same time? Many of the problems seem trivially solveable from a naieve perspective, so what exactly had Uncle Sam gotten himself into? In this post I would like to take and a look at what the biggest issues facing the united states are. I don't intend to make this a political post, the political discussion is about how (and if) the problems should be solved. Since I'm often frustrated with how politically colored the information I receive from news outlets is I would like to do my own homework for a change and share the goods :).I'm more interested in trying to take a facts-based, unbiased look at what exactly can be done better in the US (and maybe also what it does do properly). 

This post is intended to be alive and updated frequently as I learn more about the country, and I would like to use it as an ever-growing repository of information about this country that fascinates me so endlessly. Oh and feel free to contribute/comment of course, I don't have all the facts!!

## The Federal Budget

[This website](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/budget_gs.php) fascinates me quite a bit, it allows me to concisely view the way the US spends it's federal budget. The nominal values aren't particularly relevant, therefore I will base my analysis and comparison with other countries in percenatges of GDP.
